Yelp, the renowned platform for local business reviews and reservations, has opened its vast data treasury to the public. This San Francisco-based company's initiative invites researchers, data scientists, and curious minds to explore and analyze millions of user-generated reviews and business information.
The Yelp Dataset Challenge offers a unique opportunity to uncover hidden insights and trends in local business data. Whether you're into natural language processing, sentiment analysis, or discovering market patterns, this dataset provides a rich playground for innovation and discovery.

## Azure
Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. It provides a wide range of services including:

1)Computing power for running applications
2)Storage and databases
3)Networking capabilities
4)Artificial intelligence and machine learning tools
5)Internet of Things (IoT) services
6)DevOps and development tools

Azure allows businesses to build, run, and manage applications across multiple clouds and on-premises without having to maintain physical hardware. It's designed to be flexible, scalable, and cost-effective, supporting various programming languages and frameworks.

We'll utilize Databricks, Azure Storage, and Azure Data Factory for this project.
